# Save and load roles

These `Role` instance methods provide flexibility and interoperability in working with role instances, allowing you to easily convert between different representations while maintaining the core role data and behavior.

#### `toObject`:

This method converts the current `Role` instance into a plain JavaScript object representation (`GetRoleConfig<T>`).

* It captures attributes such as name, description, meta, config, permissions, and resources.
* You can provide an optional `transform` function as a parameter to further process the resulting object. This can be useful for custom transformations or additional processing.
* If no `transform` function is provided, the method returns the plain object representation of the role.

#### `fromObject`:&#x20;

* Creates a new role instance from a plain JavaScript object representation.

#### `toJSON`:&#x20;

* This method converts the current `Role` instance into a JSON string representation.
* It gathers attributes like name, description, meta, and config.
* Similarly, you can pass a `transform` function as an argument to perform additional processing on the resulting JSON string.
* If no `transform` function is provided, the method returns the JSON string representation of the role.

#### `fromJSON`:&#x20;

* Creates a new role instance from a JSON string representation.

**`from`:**

* This method creates a new `Role` instance from external data by applying a transformation function.
* It's particularly useful when you want to create a `Role` instance from data of an unknown format or when you need to perform additional transformations on the input data before creating the role.
* The method takes two arguments:
  * `data`: The input data for creating the role instance.
  * `transform`: A function that converts the input data to a role configuration (compatible with `GetRoleConfig<T>`).
* The function returns a new `Role` instance created from the transformed data.
* An example use case is provided that demonstrates creating a role from encrypted data using a custom transformation function. This is especially helpful for scenarios where you need to preprocess the data before creating a `Role` instance.
* This method allows you to handle scenarios where the input data might require special handling or transformation before creating a `Role` instance, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of your class.

These methods provide convenient ways to serialize and deserialize role instances, allowing you to store or transmit role data in different formats (such as objects or JSON strings) and recreate role instances from those formats when needed.

By using `toObject` and `fromObject`, you can convert a role instance to a plain object and recreate a role instance from that object, respectively. This can be useful when you want to store or transmit the role data as a plain JavaScript object.

Similarly, `toJSON` and `fromJSON` enable you to convert a role instance to a JSON string and create a role instance from that JSON string, respectively. This can be helpful when you need to serialize the role data for storage, transmission, or interoperability with other systems that expect JSON-formatted data.
