# Create a new Role instance

You can create a new role instance by using the `Role` class.

```ts
import { Role } from '@iamjs/core';

const role = new Role({
    name: 'role',
    description: 'role description',
    meta: {
      key: 'value'
    },
    config: {
      user: {
        base: 'crudl',
        custom: {
          ban: false
        }
      },
      post: {
        base: '-rudl',
        custom: {
          publish: true
        }
      }
    }
  });
```

This code creates a new instance of the `Role` class. The `Role` constructor takes an object as its parameter, which defines the properties of the role.

* `name` (string): Specifies the name of the role.
* `description` (string): Provides a description of the role.
* `meta` (object): An optional object that can hold additional metadata for the role.
* `config` (object): Contains configuration options for the role. It consists of resource permissions, where each resource is defined as a key in the `config` object.

In this example:

* There are two resources defined: `user` and `post`.
* The `user` resource has default permissions set to `'crudl'`, which typically stands for create, read, update, delete, and list.
* The `user` resource also has a custom permission `ban` set to `false`.
* The `post` resource has default permissions set to `'-rudl'`. The prefixing dash (`-`) before `rudl` signifies that the `read` permission is set to `false`.
* The `post` resource has a custom permission `publish` set to `true`.

The resulting `role` object represents a role with the specified name, description, metadata, and resource permissions.
