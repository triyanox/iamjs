# Show component based on permission

This example also demonstrates the usage of the Show component for conditional rendering based on the user's permssions.

1. Import the necessary components and functions from the packages:

```javascript
import { Role } from '@iamjs/core';
import { createSchema, useAuthorization } from '@iamjs/react';
```

2. Create a schema using the `createSchema` function:

```javascript
const schema = createSchema({
  user: new Role({
    name: 'user',
    description: 'User role',
    meta: {
      name: 'user'
    },
    config: {
      books: {
        base: 'crudl',
        custom: {
          upgrade: true,
          downgrade: false,
          sort: true
        }
      }
    }
  })
});
```

The schema is created in the same way as in the previous example, with a role named 'user' and its permissions for the 'books' resource.

3. Use the `useAuthorization` hook to access the authorization components:

```javascript
const { Show } = useAuthorization(schema);
```

The `useAuthorization` hook is used to access the authorization components. In this example, only the `Show` component is extracted from the returned object.

4. Render the `Show` component with the appropriate props:

```javascript
<Show role="user" resources="books" actions="create">
  <div>can show</div>
</Show>
```

The `Show` component is used to conditionally render the child components based on the user's role and permissions. It takes props specifying the role, resources, and actions, and renders the child components if the user has permission.&#x20;

In summary, this example demonstrates how to use the `Show` component from the `@iamjs/react` package to conditionally render components based on the user's role and permissions. The component is rendered within the `Show` component's block if the user has the specified role, resources, and actions.
