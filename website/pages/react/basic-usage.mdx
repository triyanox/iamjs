# Basic usage

This example demonstrates the usage of the `@iamjs/core` and `@iamjs/react` packages for role-based authorization.

1. Import the necessary components and functions from the packages:

```javascript
import { Role } from '@iamjs/core';
import { createSchema, useAuthorization } from '@iamjs/react';
```

2. Create a schema using the `createSchema` function:

```javascript
const schema = createSchema({
  user: new Role({
    name: 'user',
    description: 'User role',
    meta: {
      name: 'user'
    },
    config: {
      books: {
        base: 'crudl',
        custom: {
          upgrade: true,
          downgrade: false,
          sort: true
        }
      }
    }
  })
});
```

In this example, the schema is created with a single role named 'user'. The role has a description, meta data, and configuration for the 'books' resource. The 'books' resource has 'crudl' scopes (create, read, update, delete, list), and additional custom permissions such as 'upgrade', 'downgrade', and 'sort'.

3. Use the `useAuthorization` hook to access the authorization methods:

```javascript
const { can } = useAuthorization(schema);
```

The `useAuthorization` hook takes the schema as a parameter and returns an object that includes the `can` method to check permissions.

4. Use the `can` method to check if the user has permission:

```javascript
const canDo = can('user', 'books', 'create').toString(); // 'true'
```

The `can` method is called with the role name ('user'), the resource name ('books'), and the action ('create'). It returns a boolean value indicating whether the user with the 'user' role has permission to create books.

In summary, this example demonstrates how to create a schema with a role and its permissions using the `@iamjs/core` package. Then, the `@iamjs/react` package is used to access the `useAuthorization` hook and check permissions using the `can` method.&#x20;
